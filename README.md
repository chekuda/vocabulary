# CHECKUDAS-VOCABULARY-API

  I will use this as a template for my next projects which needs an express server in the BackEnd.
  Also a REST API will be set up here

  ### Run it
    npm install && npm run start
    `ie: localhost:3000//api/getvocabulary/vocabulary.json`

  ### REST API
    All the server configuration is inside the `server-config` folder where you can find routes and controllers

  ### Common paths
    All the paths will be gather in this file `common-paths` in order to get a order of all the relative paths
